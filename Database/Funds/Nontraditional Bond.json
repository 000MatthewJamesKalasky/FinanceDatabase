In 1977 he became a registered representative with Underwood, Neuhaus & Co. in Dallas, TX. He adopted the Kensington name in 1984. The firm specializes in developing quantitative decision models that apply to the equity and fixed income markets and has licensed these models to a variety of financial firms over the years. Kensington received the highest national ranking for equity market performance by MoniResearch Newsletter, an independent rating service, for the period 1984 to 1987. Starting in 1992, he shifted focus to high-yield corporate bonds using separately managed accounts. He is a founding member of The National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM).\n\nSince 1992, Mr. DeLaurentis has guided the Kensington Managed Income program through two major bear markets, 2000 to 2002, and 2007 to 2009 with positive outcomes in both instances. Over that time, Managed Income has compiled one of the best track records in the U.S. for a tactical high-yield bond strategy. All of the quantitative/mathematical algorithms that drive Managed Income were created by Mr. DeLaurentis who is now broadening the product suite at Kensington. The new product suite includes several equity products along with the firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fixed-income offerings. Mr. DeLaurentis is spearheading a new growth cycle at Kensington which entails moving the company onto an array of institutional platforms so that a broader cross-section of the investment community will be able to access Kensington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s elite risk-mitigated outcomes.\n\nHe attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and graduated in 1975 from Hofstra University in New York with a bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree in economics. He was a chief warrant officer in the U.S. Army and served as a helicopter pilot. Following a tour in Vietnam from 1967 to 1968, he served as an instructor pilot.

        "manager_bio": "Mr. DeLaurentis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 investment experience began in 1969 as an active trader and student of the stock market. In 1977 he became a registered representative with Underwood, Neuhaus & Co. in Dallas, TX. He adopted the Kensington name in 1984. The firm specializes in developing quantitative decision models that apply to the equity and fixed income markets and has licensed these models to a variety of financial firms over the years. Kensington received the highest national ranking for equity market performance by MoniResearch Newsletter, an independent rating service, for the period 1984 to 1987. Starting in 1992, he shifted focus to high-yield corporate bonds using separately managed accounts. He is a founding member of The National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM).\n\nSince 1992, Mr. DeLaurentis has guided the Kensington Managed Income program through two major bear markets, 2000 to 2002, and 2007 to 2009 with positive outcomes in both instances. Over that time, Managed Income has compiled one of the best track records in the U.S. for a tactical high-yield bond strategy. All of the quantitative/mathematical algorithms that drive Managed Income were created by Mr. DeLaurentis who is now broadening the product suite at Kensington. The new product suite includes several equity products along with the firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fixed-income offerings. Mr. DeLaurentis is spearheading a new growth cycle at Kensington which entails moving the company onto an array of institutional platforms so that a broader cross-section of the investment community will be able to access Kensington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s elite risk-mitigated outcomes.\n\nHe attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and graduated in 1975 from Hofstra University in New York with a bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree in economics. He was a chief warrant officer in the U.S. Army and served as a helicopter pilot. Following a tour in Vietnam from 1967 to 1968, he served as an instructor pilot. Mr. DeLaurentis is currently an Investment Advisor Representative with Advisors Preferred, LLC.",
