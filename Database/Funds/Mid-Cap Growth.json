The fund invests primarily in a diversified portfolio of equity securities with relatively smaller capitalizations as compared to the overall U.S. market. Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in the equity securities of small- and mid-capitalization companies. For these purposes, \"small- and mid-capitalization companies\" are generally those companies that, at the time of investment, fall within the lowest 25% of the total U.S. equity market capitalization (excluding, for purposes of this calculation, companies with market capitalizations of less than $10 million).",
