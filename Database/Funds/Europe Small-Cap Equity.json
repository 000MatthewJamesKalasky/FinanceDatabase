    "summary": "The Fund employs a bottom-up investment process to construct a concentrated portfolio of shares in small European companies. The Fund primarily aims to use participation exemption (âdeelnemingsvrijstellingâ) and therefore the investments are usually at least 5% of the nominal paid-up capital of the company. The Fund strives to be an engaged shareholder in companies in which it participates. The Fund aims to generate a long-term total return of 10% on an annual basis, comprising net capital gains or losses plus dividend. The Shareholderâs return will comprise movements in the price of Shares in the Fund as well as dividends to be paid by the Fund, if any.",
