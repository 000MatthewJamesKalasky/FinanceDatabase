The Portfolio is structured as a âfund-of-funds,â which means that it seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing its assets, under normal circumstances, in a combination of other mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (collectively, the underlying funds), rather than investing directly in stocks, bonds and other instruments. Under normal circumstances, the Portfolio targets an allocation of approximately 70% of its assets to the underlying equity funds and the remaining 30% of its assets to the underlying fixed income funds.",
