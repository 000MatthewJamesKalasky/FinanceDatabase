The Fund falls within the Canadian Dividend & Income Equity investment fund category. As such, the Fundâs investment portfolio is focused on Canadian domiciled, dividend-paying, equity securities, which represents at least 70% of its equity portfolio. The Fundâs objective is to provide its shareholders with (in order of priority): (i) an above average distribution yield; (ii) growth in the absolute level of distributions per share through time; and (iii) long-term appreciation of capital. The Fundâs portfolio advisor believes long-term capital appreciation is a consequence of focusing on attractive growth of dividend investments purchased at a reasonable price. The portfolio advisor has termed this form of investing âdividend-growth-at-a-reasonable-priceâ, or âDGARPâ.",
