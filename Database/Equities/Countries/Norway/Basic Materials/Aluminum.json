It operates through six segments: Bauxite & Alumina, Aluminium Metal, Metal Markets, Rolling, Extrusions, and Energy. The Bauxite & Alumina segment engages in bauxite mining activities, production of alumina, and related commercial activities, primarily the sale of alumina. The Aluminium Metal segment is involved in the primary aluminum production, remelting, and casting activities. This segment principally offers extrusion, sheet, and standard ingots, as well as foundry alloys. The Metal Markets segment sells products from the company's primary metal plants; operates remelters; and trades in physical and financial metals. The Rolling segment operates rolling mills and a primary metal plant. This segment principally offers aluminum foils, strips, sheets, and lithographic plates for application in the packaging, automotive, building and general engineering, and transport industries, as well as for offset printing plates. The Extrusions segment offers extrusion profiles, building systems, and precision tubing products for construction, automotive and heating, and ventilation and air conditioning sectors. The Energy segment owns and operates 40 hydroelectric power plants in Norway. Norsk Hydro ASA was founded in 1905 and is headquartered in Oslo, Norway.",
