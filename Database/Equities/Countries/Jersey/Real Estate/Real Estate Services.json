        "summary": "Circle is amongst the best performing quoted UK real estate companies by NAV total return (NAV growth and dividend) having delivered consistent returns with 87% NAV growth since IPO in 2016 in absolute terms. Circle focusses on acquiring assets in regional cities, many of which have significant office supply constraints, and on office assets with active management potential (refurbishment opportunities, under-rented or vacant properties or short leases), rather than just maximising initial rental yields. Circle is not a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) and can actively recycle proceeds from asset sales into its refurbishment and redevelopment pipeline, as well as future investment opportunities, therefore targeting a broader range of returns for shareholders, which are primarily driven by NAV growth. As well as already delivering substantial increases in NAV, the Company's portfolio has significant reversionary potential with current total estimated rental values of approximately \u00c2\u00a310.9 million per annum, compared to contracted rent of \u00c2\u00a38.2 million at 30 September 2019. The Company has a portfolio of 15 regional commercial property investment and development assets in the UK valued at \u00c2\u00a3135.6 million as at 30 September 2019.",
