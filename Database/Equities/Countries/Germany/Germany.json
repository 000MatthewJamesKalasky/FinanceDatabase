Gathered in the business unit Other Investments (EUR 2.3 billion in assets under management) are strategic financial investments, the management of properties in which the company holds no equity stakes, equity investments in property developments and joint venture investments.

It operates through three segments: Radiation Therapy, Radiopharma, and Isotope Products. The Radiation Therapy segment develops, manufactures, markets, and sells radioactive products for cancer therapy. This segment offers small radioactive implants for the treatment of prostate cancer seeds; and tumor radiation devices and eye applicators. This segment's products and equipment are used by oncologists, radiotherapists, urologists, ophthalmologists, and medical physicists. The Radiopharma segment operates in the field of molecular imaging and nuclear medicine; and supplies various radiopharmaceuticals, radiochemicals, and related equipment for the synthesis and radiochromatography of PET/SPECT tracers and other radioisotopes. This segment provides products in the categories of radiosynthesis technology, radiochromatography, and radionuclides. The Isotope Products segment offers sealed and unsealed radiation sources for medical imaging, industrial gauging, measurement and analysis, reference, calibration, and environmental monitoring sources and solutions; and bulk radioisotopes for pharmaceutical, therapeutic, and industrial product manufacturers. It also provides custom and one-off design and manufacturing services. In addition, the company offers services for collection, recycling, and disposal of sealed radioactive sources and low activity isotope related waste from hospitals, research institutes, and industries. Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG was founded in 1992 and is headquartered in Berlin, Germany.",
