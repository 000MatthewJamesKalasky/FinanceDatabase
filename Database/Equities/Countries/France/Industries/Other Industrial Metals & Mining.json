        "summary": "ERAMET S.A. operates as a mining and metallurgical company worldwide. It operates through two divisions, Mining and Metals; and High Performance Alloys. The Mining and Metals division extracts and processes manganese ore, nickel ore, and mineral sands. It also produces ferronickel, high purity nickel metal, nickel salts, nickel and cobalt chlorides, nickel carbonate, nickel ferroalloys, and other metallic salts used in stainless steel, catalysis and pigments, and alloy steel and casting; manganese alloys, such as high-carbon ferromanganese, silicomanganese, low and medium-carbon ferromanganese, and low-carbon silicomanganese for use in batteries, fertilizers, pigments, different reagents, construction, and automotive industries; and mineral sands, such as titanium dioxide, high-purity pig iron, zircon, and ilmenite used in ceramics and pigments. This division operates Moanda mine in Gabon; nickel mines in New Caledonia and Indonesia; and mineral sand mine in Senegal and Argentina. The High Performance Alloys division designs, develops, and transforms special steels and super alloys for the aeronautics and power generation sectors; die-forged parts and rolled and forged products; high-performance steels, high-speed steels, aluminum alloys, and titanium alloys; and metal powders to aerospace, energy, defense, automotive, tooling, and additive manufacturing industries. This division also engages in the recycling of catalysts, metal oxides, and batteries. Its products are available in the form of powders, round and flat bars, wires, and strips. The company was incorporated in 1880 and is headquartered in Paris, France.",
