It is developing Allocetra, an off-the-shelf cell therapy designed to reprogram macrophages into homeostatic state. Resetting non-homeostatic macrophages into homeostatic state is critical for immune system rebalancing and resolution of life-threatening conditions. Diseases, such as solid cancers, sepsis, COVID-19, and others reprogram macrophages out of homeostatic state. Its Allocetra has the potential to provide a novel immunotherapeutic mechanism of action for life-threatening clinical indications that are defined as unmet medical needs, as a stand-alone therapy or in combination with therapeutic agents. The company has a research collaboration with Yale Cancer Center for the assessment of Allocetra to enhance the activity of checkpoint inhibitors in solid tumors.
