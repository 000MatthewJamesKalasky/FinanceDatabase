After the establishment of the real estate investment company, Emlak Konut initiated 139 new projects that would have a broad effect on the world, embody environmentally conscious technologies and add value to cities. The number of units built and tendered since 2003 has reached 129.000 Emlak Konut went public twice, crowning its fast growth and taking its targets to wider horizons.
