The boutique Chongqing IFS, featuring the largest cluster of first-tier brands in Chongqing, was opened in 2017.

The Group also owns and operates Modern Terminals and Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals, key components in Hong Kong's success as a hub for international trade and international transportation for decades. CME2 is the Group's long-term investment, representing a strategic initiative of reinvesting capital and profit released from the CME1 exit in Hong Kong in a progressive new economy infrastructure CME2 arena that covers much larger markets with greater growth potential. \u00c2\u0093Building for Tomorrow\u00c2\u0094 also extends to Wharf's \u00c2\u0093Business-in-Community\u00c2\u0094 (\u00c2\u0093BIC\u00c2\u0094) pursuit.
