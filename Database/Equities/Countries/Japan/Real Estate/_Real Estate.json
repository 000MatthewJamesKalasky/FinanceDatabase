Onsen, a much-loved feature of Japanese life for many centuries, are part of the country's culture that is built into daily lifestyles and leisure activities. In today's aging society, demand for onsen and spas is at an unprecedentedly high level, especially among senior citizens. With the added influx of overseas visitors due to the boom in tourism and rising demand in time-consumption-type industries due to Japan's mature consumer society, we see onsen as a sector with a promising future, supported by a large customer base. Leisure industries centered on onsen facilities, however, need investment and other means of introducing the new operating methods and facility upgrades that will enable them to continually boost customer satisfaction in response to customer needs. This requires access to quality funding from the capital markets. Ooedo Onsen Reit seeks to contribute to revitalizing local industries based on onsen facilities and to popularize onsen culture, making it an extension of everyday life.

Ichigo Office is managed by Ichigo Investment Advisors, the asset management subsidiary of Ichigo, a major Japanese real estate owner/operator. Ichigo Investment Advisors works to grow value on behalf of shareholders by deploying its deep experience and know-how in developing, operating, and managing Japanese real estate. The mid-size offices in which we invest produce stable cashflows, supporting stable dividends for shareholders. Also, this economically-sensitive asset class provides upside for shareholders via the possibility of higher rent income as the Japanese economy shows signs of emerging from multiple decades of deflation. Furthermore, because the market for mid-size offices in Japan is relatively inefficient and has less participation by other major real estate companies, who tend to focus on larger assets, there is a significant opportunity to add value and increase the profitability of the assets we acquire.",
