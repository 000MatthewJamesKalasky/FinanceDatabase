        "summary": "Hoshino Resorts REIT, Inc. (HRR) was publicly listed in 2013 as one of the smallest listed real estate investment trusts (REIT) in the world. Our innovative approach includes being the first REIT to include traditional wooden Ryokans (Japanese-style inns). Since then, we have steadily achieved enhancing unitholder value by increasing our asset scale by approximately 10 times from the time of listing, and our distributions have approximately doubled compared to the second period after our public listing. Looking forward, we aim to achieve further growth by establishing a cycle of increasingly robust competitiveness at Hoshino Resorts. Looking ahead, HRR will continue to pursue stable financial management, aiming to grow its asset scale to achieve robust portfolio expansion and contribute to the tourism industry. We hope for your continued support and encouragement.",

He called upon his disciples to give total focus and sincerity to each act of the tea ceremony for every guest, because that particular moment will only exist once and must be fully lived and realized. In sharing this Ichigo name, Ichigo Office REIT embraces this philosophy of total, committed engagement to supporting the long-term success and growth of our tenants and shareholders.

        "summary": "Ooedo Onsen Reit Investment Corporation (\u00c2\u0093Ooedo Onsen Reit\u00c2\u0094) was listed on the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange on August 31, 2016, as a unique J-REIT specializing in investment mainly in onsen (hot spring) and spa-related facilities. Onsen, a much-loved feature of Japanese life for many centuries, are part of the country's culture that is built into daily lifestyles and leisure activities. In today's aging society, demand for onsen and spas is at an unprecedentedly high level, especially among senior citizens. With the added influx of overseas visitors due to the boom in tourism and rising demand in time-consumption-type industries due to Japan's mature consumer society, we see onsen as a sector with a promising future, supported by a large customer base. Leisure industries centered on onsen facilities, however, need investment and other means of introducing the new operating methods and facility upgrades that will enable them to continually boost customer satisfaction in response to customer needs. This requires access to quality funding from the capital markets. Ooedo Onsen Reit seeks to contribute to revitalizing local industries based on onsen facilities and to popularize onsen culture, making it an extension of everyday life. To this end, we will act as a bridge between onsen-based industries and the capital markets, promoting investment that helps to preserve and expand onsen culture.",
