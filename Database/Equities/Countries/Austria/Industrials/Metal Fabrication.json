The company operates in Steel and Industrial segments. It offers magnesia spinel, dolomite, dolomite-magnesia, magnesia-chrome, alumina, alumina silicate, and mortars for the cement industry; shaped products based on silicon carbide, magnesia, zirconium, fireclay, and alumina; unshaped refractories; and high-temperature insulation, and ceramic and metallic anchoring systems. This also provides solutions for various furnaces, domes and deltas, ladles, AOD converters, valves and valve seats, caps and plugs, isostatic refractory products, tundish materials, and slide gate refractories and systems; and unshaped products and ceramically bonded bricks used in glass melting process. In addition, it offers bricks and mixes, and prefab components, as well as special machinery, repair systems, and technical equipment for refractory products; and precast-shapes, alumina-silica, high alumina and insulating monolithic parts, monolithic products, high-purity magnesia and magnesia chromite bricks, magnesia-carbon and alumina-chromia bricks, concrete with anti-wetting systems, ceramic and metal anchors, sense and insulating concretes, ramming mixes, and low cement castables. Further, the company provides repair and maintenance mixes, high silicon carbide content concretes, and other products for pulp and paper industry; and raw magnesite, caustic and sintered magnesia, dolomite, magnesia products, slag conditioners, magnesium oxide, spinels, agalmatolite, chromite, grogs, and commodities. Additionally, it offers electromechanical maintenance, repairs, assembly, refractory maintenance and application, engineering, projects and lining, and metal working services; and products and services for the steel industry processes. RHI Magnesita N.V. was founded in 1834 and is headquartered in Vienna, Austria.",
