        "summary": "AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. produces and sells engineered specialty metals and mineral products. It also provides vacuum furnace systems and services to the transportation, infrastructure, energy, and specialty metals and chemicals markets. The company operates through two segments, AMG Critical Materials and AMG Technologies. The AMG Critical Materials segment develops and produces specialty metals, such as ferrovanadium, ferronickel-molybdenum, aluminum master alloys and powders, chromium metals, tantalum, lithium, antimony, natural graphite, and silicon metals for energy, aerospace, infrastructure, and specialty metal and chemicals applications. This segment also offers alloys, chemicals, and high-performance materials. The AMG Engineering segment designs, engineers, and produces vacuum furnace systems, including vacuum remelting, vacuum induction melting, vacuum heat treatment, and high pressure gas quenching, turbine blade coating, and sintering systems. This segment also provides vacuum case-hardening heat treatment services on a tolling basis; operates vacuum heat treatment facilities; and develops titanium aluminides and titanium alloys, primarily for the aerospace and energy industries. The company primarily operates in the United States, Germany, China, Italy, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, Brazil, Austria, South Korea, Mexico, Belgium, Russia, Canada, India, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Poland, Turkey, Spain, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Switzerland, Australia, Thailand, Kazakhstan, Singapore, Argentina, Mozambique, and internationally.
