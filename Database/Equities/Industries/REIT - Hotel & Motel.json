Onsen, a much-loved feature of Japanese life for many centuries, are part of the country's culture that is built into daily lifestyles and leisure activities. In today's aging society, demand for onsen and spas is at an unprecedentedly high level, especially among senior citizens. With the added influx of overseas visitors due to the boom in tourism and rising demand in time-consumption-type industries due to Japan's mature consumer society, we see onsen as a sector with a promising future, supported by a large customer base. Leisure industries centered on onsen facilities, however, need investment and other means of introducing the new operating methods and facility upgrades that will enable them to continually boost customer satisfaction in response to customer needs. This requires access to quality funding from the capital markets. Ooedo Onsen Reit seeks to contribute to revitalizing local industries based on onsen facilities and to popularize onsen culture, making it an extension of everyday life. To this end, we will act as a bridge between onsen-based industries and the capital markets, promoting investment that helps to preserve and expand onsen culture.",
