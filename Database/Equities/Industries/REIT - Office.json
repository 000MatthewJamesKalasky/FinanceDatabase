Also, this economically-sensitive asset class provides upside for shareholders via the possibility of higher rent income as the Japanese economy shows signs of emerging from multiple decades of deflation. Furthermore, because the market for mid-size offices in Japan is relatively inefficient and has less participation by other major real estate companies, who tend to focus on larger assets, there is a significant opportunity to add value and increase the profitability of the assets we acquire.",

We typically acquire central London properties off-market with low capital values and modest rents in improving locations, most of which are either in the West End or the Tech Belt. We capitalise on the unique qualities of each of our properties - taking a fresh approach to the regeneration of every building with a focus on anticipating tenant requirements and an emphasis on design. Reflecting and supporting our long-term success, the business has a strong balance sheet with modest leverage, a robust income stream and flexible financing. As part of our commitment to lead the industry in mitigating climate change, in October 2019, Derwent London became the first UK REIT to sign a Green Revolving Credit Facility. At the same time, we also launched our Green Finance Framework and signed the Better Buildings Partnership's climate change commitment.
